# cbor-fuzz

cbor-fuzz performs coverage-guided fuzzing for a [CBOR library](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor) (fxamacker/cbor).

Input data for fuzzing is inside the corpus folder. The initial content includes:
* 4 files related to COSE and WebAuthn.
* 82 files with [RFC 7049 test data](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#appendix-A) as seed.
* 340 files generated by fuzzing for 50 hours with 2 workers on AMD EPYC 7601 virtual machine.

During fuzzing, new files are created in these folders:
* corpus -- input data 
* crashers -- crash reports
* suppressions -- stacktraces to ignore 

## Installation
cbor-fuzz uses dvyukov/go-fuzz.
```
go get -u github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/go-fuzz github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/go-fuzz-build
go get -u github.com/fxamacker/cbor github.com/fxamacker/cbor-fuzz
``` 

## Usage
Reusing the same corpus folder is recommended, to benefit from corpus generated during prior fuzzing.

```
cd cbor-fuzz
go-fuzz-build .
go-fuzz
```

## Example output 
Output from cbor-fuzz fuzzing fxamacker/cbor.
